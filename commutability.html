        <h2>Overview</h2>
        At Bing Maps, we wanted to help people who were in search 
        of a home and cared about their commute. When shopping for a house, there are many factors that people consider and try to balance: price, beds, baths, nearby ammenities, commute time. Using the OneMap framework, the home-searcher can filter on many of these factors and start using the map to explore homes that are in their ideal location.
         <br><br>
         One of the ways that Bing Maps helps people find that perfect location 
         is by showing a commute boundary. A user can select a location that they 
         frequently visit — their office, their school, their parent’s place — and 
         let us know how much time they’re willing to spend getting there. Based on 
         this information we draw a commute boundary on the map and the user can see 
         which houses fall inside that boundary.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        The commutability feature was the first data viz of its kind to be 
        built for Bing Maps. As a result, in addition to designing the UX and 
        the map visuals for the feature, I needed to make sure the solution 
        scaled to future visualizations. This was tricky because of the varying complexities of 
        the different data viz UX needs. Some just need a legend (i.e. traffic layer) while others
        such as the commutability layer need more complex UI to customize the layer. 

        <br><br>

        Another challenge in this project was finding the balance between adding powerful features and keeping the UI easy to use.
        Since this is a foreign feature to our users, I erred on the side of simplicity to keep the UI from being intimidating.
        An example of where this is reflected in the UI is the decision I made to use an "peak/off peak" toggle versus asking the user
        to put in a specific time and date that they want to check commutability for.

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          Designing and building this feature was a successful collaboration with the real estate team and 
          it also resulted in a framework to build more data viz on Bing maps going forward.
