        <h2>Overview</h2>
            This project came out of a need to unify all of the map experiences on desktop Bing. 
            Various search segments such as hotels or real estate showed their data on map experiences that were all 
            slightly different. This impeded our users’s ability to learn how to interact efficiently since the interactions 
            and map elements were varied between experiences. Unifying all of the map experiences wasn’t an easy feat, 
            however. All segments had different needs and varied ideas of how those needs should be solved. We walked 
            a very fine line between enforcing the framework rules to create a predictable experience for our users 
            and satisfying individual segment’s needs.

      <h2>Process</h2>
      After we identified the problem of too many different map canvases, 
      we started talking to the different segments teams to understand 
      their needs for a map framework. One of the success metrics was 
      adoption of the framework by other teams, as a result, a strong 
      collaboration with segment teams was key in this project.
      <br><br>
      Conversations with segment teams revealed a few common needs: 
      prominent and rich filters for list searches, show-me and data 
      viz layers, viewing a list result and a detail card side by side 
      and rich custom detail card modules.
      <br><br>
      After gaining an understanding of what partners need in their experiences 
      based on their domain knowledge as well as their users studies, we did 
      an audit on our existing Bing maps website. The goal of the audit was to 
      examine which parts and features were key to the user scenarios and which 
      we could clean up. 
      <br><br>

      We then created wireframes in which we defined where elements 
      such as list results and filters live and we highlighted which 
      parts of the map overlay were customized by the segment and which 
      parts are consistent across segments. This process had quite a few 
      iterations and back and forth with segments until a consensus was reached.
      <br><br>
      In the image below, the content of the areas in red was decided to be owned 
      by segments, given that it falls into pre-defined templates:

    </div>
    <div class='col-xs-1 col-sm-1 col-md-2'>  </div>
    <div class='clearfix'></div>
    <div class='spacer'></div>

    <!--map ownership image-->
    <div class="col-xs-1 col-sm-1 col-md-2"></div>
    <div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-10 col-md-8 inline_image">
      <img class="img-responsive" src="images/ownership.png" alt="OneMap wireframe">  
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-1 col-sm-1 col-md-2"></div>
    <div class='clearfix'></div>
    <div class='spacer'></div>

    <!--process description continued-->
    <div class='col-xs-1 col-sm-1 col-md-2'></div>
    <div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-10 col-md-8 project_body">
      The next step was to dive deeper into the design of each 
      element and create layouts that can scale to different segments. 
      These included: list results, detail cards, the filters bar, data 
      viz control, maps task bar and show-me layers. 

      <br><br>
      Here is an example of list layout explorations. Some segments such as 
      hotels search, needed the ability for the user to scan the list fast 
      and compare the hotels to one another. Other categories such as trails, 
      benefited from a larger image— the image was an important decision factor for users. 
      I designed a few various list layouts and worked with a user researcher 
      to identify pros and cons of each layout. Based on the user study results 
      and polar needs, we decided to have two available layouts for segments 
      to use — image focused layout (#1) and a content focused layout (#3).

    <div class='col-xs-1 col-sm-1 col-md-2'>  </div>
    <div class='clearfix'></div>
    <div class='spacer'></div>

      This framework has been built but continues to evolve as we learn from our users 
      and find improvements. Here are examples of how a few segments carried out 
      their designs on the map:

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    I consider this a successful project and collaboration effort. 
    Using this framework, the real estate, hotels, restaurants, 
    itinerary and outdoor segment teams were able to build rich experiences 
    that have high engagement by our users. The Maps team benefited from 
    having our map canvas used in more search scenarios. Finally, most 
    importantly, our users benefited from this effort because now they 
    are getting a familiar, rich and useful map experience regardless of 
    what they’re searching for.
