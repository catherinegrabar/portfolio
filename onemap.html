        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Bing is comprised of many teams, each with their own metrics of success.  Each team's drive to optimize their own success criteria lead to slightly different map user interfaces on desktop Bing.  For example, the map would appear differently if searching for hotels or for real estate.  The discrepancy in map behavior impeded the overall quality of user experience by presenting the users with an inconsistent interface.</p>
        <p>The OneMap project was created to unify the style of all map experiences on desktop Bing. Unifying all of the map experiences was a challenging feat because so many teams had a stake in the final design. And all teams had ideas of how those needs should be solved.  When designing for OneMap, I walked a fine line between enforcing framework rules to create a predictable experience for users and satisfying the needs of Bing's segmented teams.</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>After identifying the problem of different map canvases, we started talking to the different segments teams to understand their needs for a map framework. One of the success metrics was adoption of the framework by other teams.  Consequently, a strong collaboration with segment teams was key.</p>
      <p>Conversations with segment teams revealed a few common needs: prominent and rich filters for list searches, show-me and data viz layers, viewing a list result and a detail card side by side and rich custom detail card modules.</p>
      <p>After gaining an understanding of what partners need in their experiences based on their domain knowledge as well as their users studies, we did an audit on our existing Bing maps website. The goal of the audit was to examine which parts and features were key to the user scenarios and which 
      we could clean up.</p> 
      <p>We then created wireframes in which we defined where elements such as list results and filters live. We highlighted which parts of the map overlay were customized by the segment and which parts are consistent across segments. This process had quite a few iterations with segments until a consensus was reached.</p>
      <p>The image below shows areas in red that were allocated for customization by segment.  Any segment's customization must adhere to a standard template.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-10 col-sm-10 col-md-8 project_body">
      <p>The next step was to dive deeper into the design of each element and create layouts that fulfill the needs of every segment. These included: list results, detail cards, the filters bar, data viz control, maps task bar and show-me layers.</p> 
      <p>The following images show samples from the list layout exploration process. Some segments, such as hotels search, needed the ability for the user to scan the list fast and compare the hotels to one another. Other categories, such as trails, benefited from a larger image because the image was an important decision factor for users. I designed a set of list layouts and worked with a user researcher to identify pros and cons of each layout. Based on the user study results and diverging needs, we decided to have two available layouts for segments to use: an image-focused layout (#1) and a content-focused layout (#3).</p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>Using this framework, the real estate, hotels, restaurants, itinerary and outdoor segment teams were able to build rich yet consistent experiences that have high engagement by our users. The Maps team benefited from having our map canvas used in more search scenarios. Finally, most importantly, our users benefited from this effort because now they are getting a familiar, rich and useful map experience regardless of what they’re searching for.</p>
